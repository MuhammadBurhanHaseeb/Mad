# Weather Information Application

## Introduction

This Weather Information Application is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to display current weather information. Built with HTML and JavaScript, it utilizes AJAX to fetch weather data from a public API and display it dynamically on the webpage without needing to reload the page. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Weather Data**: Fetches and displays current weather information based on user input (city name).
- **AJAX-driven**: Makes asynchronous requests to a weather API for live data retrieval.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a simple and intuitive interface with an input field for the city name and a button to trigger the data fetch.

## Running the Application Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Project**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open `index.html`**: Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. **Enter a City Name**: Type the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field.
4. **Fetch Weather**: Click on the "Get Weather" button to display the weather information.

No additional setup or dependencies are required to run this application, as it is built with vanilla HTML and JavaScript.

## Application Capabilities

- **Weather Data Display**: Upon entering a valid city name and initiating the fetch operation, the application displays the following information:
  - Temperature
  - Weather condition description
  - Weather condition icon

This application is perfect for those looking to quickly check the current weather conditions without navigating away from the page or dealing with complex interfaces.

## Note

This application requires a valid API key to fetch weather data from the public API. The key should be inserted into the `script.js` file where indicated. For demonstration purposes, the API URL and key inclusion are generalized; ensure you replace them with actual data from your preferred weather data provider.
